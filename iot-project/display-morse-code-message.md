# Displaying A Morse Code Message Using A Raspberry Pi

Starting out on a Raspberry Pi can be a lot of fun. But before I started running, I had to crawl first. Since I already knew the basics of Python coding (my small step for man), I needed to learn how to use the GPIO-pins (my giant leap for mankind). For that I decided to operate some LEDs on a breadboard. This project is quite simple, so have fun!

## Equipment

For this project you would require the following:
* 1 x Raspberry Pi (I'm using the 4GB 4B+ model)
* 1 x Breadboard
* 2 x LEDs (preferable of different colours)
* 2 x 1k Ohm resistor (I used the 1k Ohm, because my 470 Ohm resistors were duds)
* 3 x Male to Female jumper cables

## Let's Make it!

### The Code

I will break up the different component of the code and give some explaination as to my reasoning for you to easily follow what I did (and hopefully not just copying and pasting :D)
